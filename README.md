skrolla
=======

A mobile reading list (powered by firebase) + chrome extension that enables you to scroll webpages using your phone's gyro.

You can [read more about skrolla here](http://challengepost.com/software/skrol-la), or you can just [try it out](http://dev.skrol.la).

_I'm no longer maintaining this skrolla, but I do still use it._
